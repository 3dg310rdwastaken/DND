				<li>Human Features:
					<ul>
						<li>One extra skill proficiency of your choosing</li>
						<li>One bonus feat of your choosing</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Outlander Feature
					<ul>
						<li>You can always remember the layout of a region's geographical features,
						and can usually find enough food and water for six people</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Warlock Features
					<ul>
						<li>Warlock Archetype: Undying -
							<ul>
								<li>The spells False Life, Ray of Sickness, Blindness/Deafness,
							Silence, Feign Death, Speak with Dead, Aura of Life, Death Ward, Contagion, and Legend Lore are added to the Warlock spell list for you.</li>
							<li>You know the Spare the Dying cantrip</li>
							<li>If an undead targets you directly with an attack or harmful spell, that creature
							must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature
							must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead of you, potentially wasting
							the attack or spell. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. 
							An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or harmful spell.</li>
							<li>You can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point) when you succeed a death saving throw or when you 
							stabilize a creature with Spare the Dying. Once you use this feature you cannot use it again 
							until you finish a long rest</li>
							<li>You can hold your breath indefinitely, and you don't require food, water, or sleep, although you still
							require rest to reduce exhaustion and still benefit from short and long rests. In addition, you age at a slower
							rate. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are immune to being magically aged.
						</li>
						<li>Eldritch Invocations:
							<ul>
								<li>Devil's Sight - You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical to a distance of 120 feet.</li>
								<li>Eldritch Armor - As an action, you can touch a suit of armor that isn't being worn or carried by anyone and instantly don it, provided you aren't wearing armor already. You are proficient with this suit of armor until it is removed.</li>
								<li>Beguiling Influence - You gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.</li>
								<li>Ghostly Gaze - As an action, you gain the ability to see through solid objects to a range of 30 feet. This special sight lasts for 1 minute or until your concentration ends. During that time, you perceive objects as ghostly transparent images. Once you use this invocation, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</li>
								<li>Eyes of the Runekeeper - You can read all writing</li>
