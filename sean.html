	<p>Features:
		<ul>
			<li>Slimefolk Features:
				<ul>
					<li>Slimefolk, being creatures of gelatinous slime, are naturally sticky.
					You have advantage on Strength checks made to grapple a target. In addition,
					you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without
					needing to make an ability check.</li>
					<li>Due to the fluid nature of your form, you can move through a space as narrow
					as 1 inch without squeezing. You leave behind any items you are carrying, and any
					which you are proficient with merges into your form until you exit the space.</li>
					<li>A sliimefolk is naturally corrosive, as such, your unarmed strikes deal acid damage
					equal to 1d4 + your Constitution modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal
					for an unarmed strike. In addition, you are resistant to acid damage.</li>
					<li>You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in
					darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</li>
					<li>You are composed of a large amount of liquid and as such, you fare poorly in burning
					environments. You have disadvantage on saving throws against Extreme Heat.</li>
					<li>For slimefolk, water is both an essential part of life and a death sentence.
					If you start your turn in a body of water, such as a lake, or an ocean, you take 1d6
					necrotic damage. Rain is similarly harmful, but only inflicts 1 necrotic damage per turn.
					If this damage reduces you to less than half of your maximum hit points,
					you are considered to be poisoned until your hit points are restored to over half
					your hit point maximum. Finally, if you are reduced to 0 hit points by this trait, you die.</li>
					<li>Your creature type is both humanoid and ooze. You don't require sleep and by moving 
					across surfaces you can break down otherwise inedible substances to garner nutritional value.</li>
					<li>Slimefolk are known for their various forms that they can take, appearing to be tall and lean
					one day, and then the next, being short and curvy. Their skin could be repelling arrows one day,
					but get pierced by them the next. At the end of a long rest, you can change simple miscellaneous details
					about yourself such as your hair's length and shape, or make yourself a bit taller, smaller, wider, or thinner.
					In addition, at the end of a long rest you can also gain a resistance of your choice from non-magical
					bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. This resistance lasts until you pick another damage type 
					with this trait.</li>
				</ul>
			</li> <br />
			<li>Isekai Feature:
				<ul>
					<li>You're not from this world, and people quickly take note of it. Some take pity on you, thinking
					you to be some sort of stranded foreigner; while others seek to take advantage of you, scamming 
					and robbing you at every turn. On a rare occasion, a great scholar or other extremely learned person will notice
					you for exactly what you are, seeking as much knowledge on your home dimension as possible. You are
					also known for having a knack for making new friends.</li>
				</ul>
			</li> <br />
			<li>Vampire Features:
				<ul>
					<li>While you are not wearing armor, your AC is equal to 10 + your Constitution modifier + your Charisma modfier.</li>
					<li>Your vampiric ability DC is 8 + your Charisma modifier + your Constitution modifier.</li>
					<li>You are vulnerable to radiant damage. If an amount of skin equal to the surfaces
					of your head or greater is in direct sunlight, you take 2d6 radiant damage every turn.
					Creatures attempting to reveal you must use an action to succeed a DC 11 + your Dexterity modifier
					+ your Charisma modifier Dexterity check. Recovering yourself requires an action. You no longer age or need to sleep.</li>
					<li>Your unarmed attacks deal 1d4 + your Dexterity modifier piercing damage, and count as magical.
					This damage increases at 5th, 8th, 17th, and 20th level.</li>
					<li>At 2nd level, you no longer benefit from consuming food. Instead, drinking a small or larger creature's
					blood gives you 1d6 days worth of food per round, but they must be dead or unconcious. Living creatures are 
					killed after 3 rounds, increasing by one round per size category above small, and dead creatures are considered
					drained after 5. At 5th level, you can initiate a Bloody Summoning, draining a prone creatures blood.
					They must succeed a Constitution saving throw or be drained for one turn and become grappled. They
					must then escape the grapple or be drained each round.</li>
					<li>At 3rd level, as an action, you can regenerate 1d6 hit points or reattach a limb. This cannot be done 
					if you took fire or radiant damage the preceding turn.</li>
					<li>At 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the attack action on your turn.
					The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 10th level in this class and to four when you reach
					15th level in this class.</li>
