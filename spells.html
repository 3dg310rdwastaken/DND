	<h1>SPELLS</h1>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Spare the Dying:
				<p>You touch a living creature that has 0 hit points. The creature stabilizes and regains
				conciousness at 1 HP. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>Eldritch Blast:
				<p>A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged
				spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage. <br /> <br />
				The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level,
				three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the
				same target or at different ones. Make a seperate attack roll for each beam.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>Mage Hand:
				<p>A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts
				for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever
				more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again. <br /> <br />
				You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object,
				open an unlocked door or container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the 
				hand up to 30 feet each time you use it. <br /> <br />
				The hand can't attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds.
				</p>
