	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Spare the Dying:
				<p>You touch a living creature that has 0 hit points. The creature stabilizes and regains
				conciousness at 1 HP. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>Eldritch Blast:
				<p>A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged
				spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage. <br /> <br />
				The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level,
				three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the
				same target or at different ones. Make a seperate attack roll for each beam.
				</p>
