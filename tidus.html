							<li>You know the Shape Water cantrip</li>
						</ul>
					</li> <br />
					<li>Ancient One Feature:
						<ul>
							<li>Ancient perspectives give one a broad range of knowledge and history to draw
							from, though they often cloud new ideas from being formed. You can often recall
							information about places that many characters have never ventured, or extrapolate
							based off similar events. Similarly, historical facts come naturally to you,
							and many a scholar or ruler values your counsel if you make it available.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li> <br />
					<li>Phoenixmancer Features:
						<ul>
							<li>At 1st level, when you die, you cause an explosion around you. Each creature in a 10 ft
							must make a Constitution saving throw. A target takes 1d10 fire damage on a failed save,
							or half as much damage on a successful one. The amount of damage increases as you gain 
							levels in this class, as shown in the Soul of the Phoenix column of the Phoenixmancer
							table. At 10th, the range is increased to 15 ft. At 15th, the range increases again
							up to 20 ft. Additionally you gain resistance to radiant damage.
							</li>
							<li>At 1st level, when you die, you instead turn to a pile of ash and an egg 3 ft wide 
							appears where you had died. You emerge from the egg after 1d4 days in peak form without 
							any of your equipment or clothing. If this egg is destroyed, you die. The egg has hit points
							equal to half of your maximum health, rounded up, and has an AC of 18.
